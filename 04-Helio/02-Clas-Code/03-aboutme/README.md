-----------------------------------------------------------

## Instructions:

Often times as a front-end web developer, you will be asked to take a Photoshop/Sketch/Illustrator file or sometimes even a plain JPEG image, and translate that into a full blown webpage. Anywhere you go, it is up to the front-end web developer to translate that. You need to slice out your own icons, your own images, basically follow the vision the designer set. This activity we are going to be focusing on layout, basic CSS and HTML5 tags, so you won't need to splice or create your own icon set.

For this activity, I will give you a simple user profile image. I want you to follow the exact layout of this picture with special attention to spacing, sizing and color. Please replace information with information about you.
