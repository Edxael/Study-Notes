            ------------------------------------


This repository will have my notes on my studies. The structure of this study repository is:

  01-Weekly Reports: 
Here there will be a file for each week subdivided by days, showing what was studied that day, and what projects were worked on.

  02-Notes: 
This directory will contain a collection of subdirectories each one for one major topic, in order to organize my studies, this will be, just notes, and proof of concept of technologies and techniques studied.

  03- Projects:
This directory will contain a subdirectory whit a specific project.




    ------- Weekly Reports --------

The reports will be organized using a year and week system, in which the first two digits will be the current year and the next two digits are the current week of the year.

Example:   17-32-Report.

In the previous example, the report contains the information for the week number 32 of the year 2017, this week extended from: 
Sunday, August 07  to   Saturday, August 12.

Note:
In order to use this system, I will be changing the starting day for each week report, from here and forward each week starts in Sunday and finish on Saturday, 



There will be some other repositories with information, or projects.
